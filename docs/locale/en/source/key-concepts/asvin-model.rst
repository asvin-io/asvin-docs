asvin Model
=================

In this section we will take a brief look at asvinâ€™s architecture and briefly 
explain its components.  Some relevant concepts and keywords are also mentioned below.

Customer Platform
#################

asvin provides a user-friendly customer platform to abstract the complexities of the background processes 
to register devices, setup & schedule firmware rollouts, define group actions on registered devices, 
and to blacklist devices. The customer platform also displays information related to firmware updates 
and provides the current version of edge devices.

Version controller
##################

The version controller maintains updated information of firmware avaliable for a particular edge device
or device group on the asvin.io platform. It is one of the core components of the asvin architecture.

Interplanetary FileSystem
#########################

Interplanetary FileSystem or IPFS is a distributed peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed 
for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS serves as one of the core 
components of the asvin architecture. asvin uses IPFS protocol to store firmware, updates 
and security patches. Check out the detailed notes on IPFS `here <https://ipfs.io/>`_.

**Content Identifier**

Data exchanges on decentralised platforms like `IPFS <https://ipfs.io/>`_ depends upon 
content-based addressing rather than local addressing to securely locate and identify data. 
A Content Identifier (CID) is a self-describing content address identifier which is a 
cryptographic hash, typically SHA-256, which is 32 bytes. The CID for a binary image file 
stored on an IPFS network might be **QmcRD4wkPPi6dig81r5sLdrtd1gDCL4zgpEj9CfuRrGbzF**.

Blockchain
##########

The Device Security Booster uses blockchain technology to store all of the transactions executed on the 
asvin.io network including: device registration, firmware upload, device update, firmware update, 
user registration, etc. All these transactions are connected with hashes and stored in blocks 
which are again linked to a secured hash. For the platform we use the 
`Hyperledger Fabric <https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric>`_ and 
`Hyperledger besu <https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu>`_ blockchains. 

**Distributed Ledger**

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a digital system for recording the transaction of assets 
in which the details of specific transactions are recorded in multiple places. 
Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have no central data storage or 
administration functionality. The above mentioned blockchain is a type of DLT.


**Smart Contracts**

A smart contract is a computer program or a digital transaction protocol which is intended to 
automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms 
of a contract or an agreement. The objective of a smart contract is to reduce the need of trusted 
intermediators, arbitration, enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the risk mitigation of 
malicious attacks and accidental exceptions.

Edge Devices
############

Edge devices are end-points in the asvin.io architecture and in an IoT network which control, 
manage and solve a specific physical task: For instance, edge devices turn on a smart washing machine 
in a house, monitoring temperature and humidity in a chemical plant or an air quality sensor 
installed in a city. These devices have microcontrollers and sensors at their core and with their 
small footprints these edge devices are easy to manage in remote areas under extreme environmental conditions. 
Examples of edge devices in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) include 
process monitoring sensors, smart meters, Lora nodes, smoke detectors, etc.
