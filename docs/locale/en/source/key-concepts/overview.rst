Overview
========

The asvin platform is underpinned by multiple decentralized technologies for distributing 
security patches for IoT devices with a higher degree of security, scalability, confidentiality 
and resiliency and  supports the full range of IoT devices and their applications. 
The platform hides the complexities and intricacies of IoT devices to provide firmware 
updates securely  while identifying the threat landscape and protecting the firmware 
and software within a secure chain of trust.

What is Firmware Update?
========================

IoT device
##########

An IoT device is a piece of hardware typically embedded with microcontrollers, sensors, 
communication modules, input/output peripherals, and software for the objective of collecting 
useful data from multiple processes and exchanging it with other connected devices 
over the internet. IoT devices are employed virtually everywhere - in smart homes, 
manufacturing plants, cities, hospitals, transporting goods, workplaces, and out in space. 

Firmware
########

Embedded software running on an IoT device is called firmware. IoT devices have a very small 
footprint and, as such, cannot run  full-fledged operating systems on them. IoT devices 
based on Arduino, ESP, TTGO, WeMoS development boards run as a standalone program. 
Deterministic multi-threaded programs can be run on more powerful boards like Nucleo, 
NuMaker, PSoC using embedded RTOS such as Mbed, FreeRTOS.

Firmware Update
###############

A firmware update is the process of somehow changing the software running on IoT devices, 
this can be done by updating the complete firmware or applying delta changes.

Why is Firmware Update Necessary?

We live in a world where technology is both a boon and curse.  On one hand, technology 
simplifies our processes  while the exploitation of its vulnerabilities by BlackHats and 
state-sponsored actors result in huge financial losses and impact the quality of life for millions. 
A proactive cybersecurity policy which includes regular updates and security patches and the 
ability to provide isolation of vulnerable IoT devices is critical.
