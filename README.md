# Documentation

If you want the world to read asvin documentation in your own language, you are welcome to translate it. The documentation is already available in German and English. Therefore, you can contribute in the existing translations or add a new language if it doesn't exist.

asvin uses [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) for software documentation. It facilitates automatic building, versioning, and hosting of the documentation. The [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) tool is used to build the documentation using the [theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme).
The documentation is generated for each commit in the master branch. Therefore, it is advised to build locally for update, preview and design.
